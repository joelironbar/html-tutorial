   <p style="font-size: 35px;">A Planet of Superlatives</p> 
  </h2>

<p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">
  Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, boasting a diameter of about 86,881 miles (139,822 kilometers). 
  This gas giant is so massive that it could fit all the other planets in the solar system inside it, with room to spare. 
  Its immense size and gravitational pull have a profound impact on the orbits of other celestial bodies, including asteroids and comets.</p>
  
<p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">
  Jupiter's atmosphere is a swirling tapestry of colors, with bands of clouds that create a stunning visual display. 
  The planet's most famous feature, the Great Red Spot, is a massive storm that has been raging for centuries. 
  This storm is so large that it could fit three Earths inside it and is a testament to the dynamic and ever-changing nature of Jupiter's atmosphere.</p>
  
<p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">
  Jupiter's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of other gases such as methane and ammonia. 
  This composition gives the planet its distinctive colors and contributes to the formation of its iconic storms. 
  The planet's rapid rotation, completing a full turn in just under 10 hours, creates powerful winds that drive the formation of these storms.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">
  Jupiter's magnetic field is the strongest of any planet in our solar system, creating a vast magnetosphere that extends millions of miles into space. 
  This magnetic field is generated by the planet's rapid rotation and the movement of metallic hydrogen within its interior. 
  The magnetosphere traps charged particles from the solar wind, creating stunning auroras at the planet's poles.</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">

  Jupiter has a diverse array of moons, with over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Jupiter"> 90 confirmed satellites.</a>
  The four largest moons, known as the Galilean moons, were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610 and include Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. 
  Each of these moons has its own unique characteristics, with Io being the most volcanically active body in the solar system, Europa harboring a subsurface ocean that may contain the ingredients for life, Ganymede being the largest moon in the solar system, and Callisto being heavily cratered and ancient.</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">
  Jupiter's immense gravity has a significant impact on the orbits of its moons, creating a complex gravitational dance that influences their geological activity and surface features. 
  The interactions between Jupiter and its moons provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems.</p>

<p style=" margin-bottom: 25px; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">
  Jupiter's exploration has been a major focus of space missions, with the most notable being NASA's Juno spacecraft, which has been studying the planet since 2016.
  Juno's mission is to understand Jupiter's composition, gravity field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere, providing valuable data about the planet's formation and evolution.
  The spacecraft has captured stunning images of Jupiter's atmosphere and polar regions, revealing intricate details about the planet's weather patterns and magnetic field.</p>
